My personal blog and portfolio website. A static site generated by [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).

## Development

    npm start

## Build and Deploy

If the site needs to be re-built, you can do that manually with:

    npm run build

The built site will be outputted to the `docs` directory. 

Then just push the `master` branch to Github. Github Pages will serve the built `docs` folder :)
