Whatever happened to Augmented Reality? There’s been a lot of hype, but
has it resulted in anything useful yet? According to the [Gartner Hype
Cycle](http://sembassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gartner-hype-cycle-2012.gif),
expectations for AR have already peaked and it’s about to move into
the *Trough of Disillusionment*.

However, I’m still excited about AR. In fact, I’m more excited about it
now than ever before. Why?

- We’re getting close to consumer-ready wearable AR devices, such as
  Google's [Project
  Glass](https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147). In a
  recent [interview on the Gavin Newsom
  Show](http://current.com/shows/the-gavin-newsom-show/videos/sergey-brin-demos-google-glasses-prototype/),
  Sergey Brin said he’s hopeful they could actually come to market
  next year. I think that these kind of devices could open up a whole
  new age for AR.

- I believe in the power of the Web. Up until now, AR has only been
  possible through native apps (or Flash). But now it’s opening up to
  Web developers and it’s possible to build AR apps using HTML, CSS
  and JavaScript.

A couple of weeks ago I gave a talk on this subject at the [London Web
meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/londonweb/). It covers Wikitude’s
ARchitect platform (a bit like PhoneGap for AR) and WebRTC (an emerging
standard for working with real-time communications through the Web).

A couple of people have asked if I’d share my slides. They’re web
slides, based on the HTML5 Rocks slide deck. But I changed the design,
added media queries and embedded a live WebRTC demo inside. If you
haven’t seen an augmented reality dinosaur in your browser before, I
encourage you to try it out!

Some quick points to note first:

- Best in Chrome or Safari. To see the AR dinosaur demo, you’ll need
  Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary
  (see: <http://www.webrtc.org/running-the-demos>)
- Best viewed in a 4:3 ratio (the ideal is full-screen at 1024x768 -
  the resolution of the projector)
- It contains lots of big images so make sure you’re on a broadband
  connection
- Press the keyboard left + right arrow keys to navigate (or swipe
  left/right on an iPhone or iPad)

And I’ve shared the code on
GitHub: <https://github.com/poshaughnessy/augmented-reality-for-web-devs>

There’s not too much text in the slides so if you would like a bit more
context, the talk was also video recorded and the video is up - thanks
