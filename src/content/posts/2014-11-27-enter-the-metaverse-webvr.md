This week I gave a presentation at the [Front Endgineers meetup](http://meetup.com/Front-Endgineers-London/events/213532342/) 
in London about Virtual Reality. I talked about why it’s an exciting time
for VR at the moment, especially for Web developers now that Google and
Mozilla are working on [WebVR](http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html).
