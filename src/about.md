## About me

Hi! I'm a developer, writer and speaker on web APIs and the future of the web. I work in developer relations for 
[Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than 
you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)).

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in
a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development
agencies.

My key technology interests are around how web and native app capabilities are converging (e.g. Progressive Web App technologies) and how the 
physical and digital worlds are converging (Physical Web, Web Bluetooth, VR, Mixed Reality...). Recently I've been becoming
more and more interested in ethical technology: how to avoid some of the problems we have seen technology contribute to recently and how to 
apply web technologies to help make the world a better place.

I've recently started coaching at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) and providing some remote mentoring for developers early on in their careers.
