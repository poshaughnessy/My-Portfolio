Back in 2006, I enthusiastically joined Facebook - as soon as I could get in with my university address. I persuaded
friends of mine to join, telling everyone how it was far superior to MySpace. Twelve years later, it's time for me to 
quit. I've written up my reasons here, partly to explain it to my friends and partly to gather my thoughts here for 
myself and steel myself for pushing the button!

## What Facebook has become

Facebook is no longer a social network. It's an advertising platform, which exploits your social network to keep you 
logging in.
 
I recently spotted Facebook's ['Advertisers with your contact info'](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/) and found
they list hundreds of companies, most of whom I've never heard of. [Apparently](https://mastodon.at/@pfigel/99469689659232810) 
this is because they allow companies (who might have purchased your contact details from other companies) to match 
their data up to your Facebook profile. 

To give these advertisers more eyeball time, Facebook are desparate to keep you 'engaged'. Hence all the push 
notifications designed to hook you back in. (If they don't have any actual news for you, they'll make something up like *"People haven't heard from you in a
while. Write a post."*)

Being so ad-focused, it's no surprise that Facebook have a terrible record on privacy. As Aleks Krotoski writes in 
[Untangling The Web](https://peteroshaughnessy.com/posts/untangling-the-web-top-quotes/): 

> "Facebook should be your worst nightmare. Global privacy watchdog Privacy International have repeatedly voted it the second worst perpetrator of "substantial and comprehensive privacy threats", beaten to the bottom only by Google."
 
Their practices have recently been [declared illegal by a Berlin regional court](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/12/facebook-personal-data-privacy-settings-ruled-illegal-german-court) 
and [a court in Belgium](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43091087).

In case you've missed it, here's some other things that they've been in the news for recently:

* [Patenting a method of determining whether you are "working class", "middle class" or "upper class"](https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/09/facebook-patents-tech-to-determine-social-class/)
* [Tempting people into using their free VPN, so they can monitor _all_ your online activity](https://gizmodo.com/do-not-i-repeat-do-not-download-onavo-facebook-s-vam-1822937825).
* [Funding the experts who gave the green light to their Messenger Kids app, aimed at children as young as six](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-funds-its-favorite-experts-but-skirts-tough-critics/amp).
* And of course, [failing to spot Russia's US election hacking](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/franken-kennedy-russia-election-interference-facebook-adverts-a8030521.html).


## It's only going to get worse

The decisions Facebook make will never truly be in our interests, because their first priority (like an 
publicly traded company) is to their shareholders. As the old saying goes, if we're not the ones paying (directly) for 
a product, we're not not the customer.

Athough Mark Zuckerberg , he can seem quite likeable and as though his heart is in the right place, despite his faults.
However, he has shown time and again that he is ruthless in business.

Facebook are investing heavily in Machine Learning and you can be sure that they will keep pushing [the Creepy Line](https://counternotions.com/2013/01/15/creepyline/)
further and further. For just an inkling of the start of this, you can check the alt tag for images you 
upload and you'll see the labels from their automatic object detection.

They're always coming up with innovative new ways to track and categorise people, whether its checking your [accelerometer and 
gyroscope readings, or detecting dust on your camera lens](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-knows-how-to-track-you-using-the-dust-on-your-1821030620),
or [monitoring posts in real time to detect vulnerable teenagers](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-manipulated-users-moods-in-secret-experiment-9571004.html).

## The longer we leave it, the harder it will be

Already, trying to quit Facebook is like that episode of Friends [when Chandler tries to quit the gym](https://youtu.be/-_LM2ZlbmP8?t=57s).
If you press the button to deactivate your account, they show you pictures of your friends saying 
"[Your friend name] will miss you!". It's not far off from emotional blackmail.

The longer we wait to leave Facebook, the more photos, posts and friends we'll have to leave behind.

This is all why - even though it's still a tough decision - I feel it's the right one for me to take today.

If you're one of my friends that I'm leaving behind on Facebook, I'm sorry if this might mean we see a bit less of each
other online. I hope that we will find other, more personal ways to keep in touch, such as emails and text messages 
(I'll try to get better with those!). I'm also on [Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/@peter), which is an open source,
decentralised network that I recommend. (I'm also still on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy) and 
even the Facebook-owned [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/poshaughnessy/) and WhatsApp, for now at least... ;-)) 

If this might just [poke](https://www.facebook.com/help/pokes) you into leaving Facebook too, I'll see you on the other 
side. Thanks for being my Facebook friend while I was on there!
