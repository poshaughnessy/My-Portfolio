This week I was invited to attend a talk by [Michael
Feathers](https://twitter.com/mfeathers) at the offices of News UK. The
topic was “The Full Spectrum Developer”.

Taking inspiration from Laurence Gellert’s post [“What is a Full _Stack_
Developer?”](http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/),
Michael talked about how we should broaden our horizons. Don’t just
master one small domain; try to understand a bit about every aspect of
your industry, from business needs, to hosting, to user experience. That
way we can contribute intelligently and reduce the communication cost
between separate teams.

It was a thought-provoking talk, so I wanted to share my notes:

- There’s a wide span in skills across the industry. What motivates
  people to go beyond?
- Curiosity? What does it mean? How do you nurture it?
- [“The Full Stack
  Developer”](http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/)
  understands the whole stack, as well as the business
- Silos don’t work well due to the communication cost
- The socio-dynamics of different teams can make things go crazy -
  “the designers don’t understand about development” - “the developers
  don’t understand about design"… We have to move away from that
- Don’t get yourself caught in a silo
- The Full Spectrum Developer knows about:
  - Server, network, and hosting environment
  - Data modelling
  - Business logic
  - API layer / Action Layer / MVC
  - User Interface
  - User Experience
  - Customer and business needs
- Know it all the way up and down the chain
- [David A.
  Thomas](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Thomas_(software_developer)>)
  is a great example of a full stack developer - knows everything from
  microprocessor coding to employee retention
- [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup)
  built C++ for himself and became the father of a language
- [Robert Fripp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp)
  continuously reinvented himself
- Be distracted sometimes
- “I can see this barrier. Can I go around it? No, I’ll break through
  it”
- “Be the stupidest person in the room” - if you’re going to
  transition to new things, get used to this
- Start asking questions early on in the conversation
- Never underestimate what you know - we all have things to contribute
- “The people who do well are people who read” - reading is
  fundamental
- Cells were the inspiration for Object Oriented Programming
- In SmallTalk, everything is an object, all the way down
- [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), creator of
  SmallTalk, is great with metaphors - take a metaphor from one part
  of the world and apply it to another
- One that didn’t really take off is
  [Lucid](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)>),
  “the dataflow programming language” - uses the metaphor of fluid
  dynamics - powerful
- [APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_programming_language) is a
  programming language that uses non-ASCII characters. Funky!
- [J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_programming_language) is derived
  from APL - Quicksort in one line!
- Challenge yourself - cultivate 3 conceptual interests outside of
  work
- E.g. Functional programming - pick something outside of your
  expertise
- Push the edges - try it out
- Different languages - build a repertoire
- Recommended books:
  - [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning, Refactor Your Wetware, Andy
    Hunt](http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning)
  - [Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software
    Craftsman, David H. Hoover & Adewale

- Learn what you need to do your job well, but take distractions - be
  curious
- Time-box it - don’t think of it as a chore
