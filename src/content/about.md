## About me

![Peter speaking at RenderConf 2018](/images/pages/about/peter-renderconf-2018.jpg)

Hi! I'm a web developer who is especially interested in web APIs and the future of the web. I'm a front-end developer and tech lead at an employee-owned retailer based in Bracknell, UK. I'm also a founder and co-organiser of [Berkshire JS](https://www.meetup.com/BerkshireJS).

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in
a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development
agencies. For over two years I was a developer advocate for [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net),
Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)).

I have a particular interest in the ethics of technology. At the organisation where I work, I set up an ethics community and an accessibility community. I'm also keen to help improve our web performance, to help our customers and to help [save waste](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/). I'm a member of [Climate Tech](https://climate-tech.slack.com) and the [Green Party](https://greenparty.org.uk).

If you would like to get in touch, please send me a message on
[Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/@peter) or [send me an email](mailto:peteroshaughnessy@protonmail.com).
