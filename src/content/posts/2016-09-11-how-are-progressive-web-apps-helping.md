Web developers have probably heard lots of buzz about [progressive web apps](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/)
by now, but why are they important? I'm collecting together stories and examples of how they have helped people,
communities and businesses.

Many of them have come from Google's [Web Showcase](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/), a great collection of
real-world examples and measurements.

### Good for people and communities

- [Inspire Hub developed an Urgent Notice feature](https://inspirehub.ihubapp.org/stories/41314) which allowed their clients
  to get messages out to residents following a natural disaster. With a PWA, they avoided app store approval processes and
  were able to respond in time to help.
- [RioRun](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/aug/19/how-we-made-the-riorun-progressive-web-app) deserves to feature here for helping
  people to get active. It is a very slick virtual audio tour from the Guardian, encouraging users to get out and run. Offline support helps it work well
  wherever you go.

### Good for business

- [The Washington Post gained](http://www.beet.tv/2016/09/wapopwamarburger.html) 5x engagement - page views per visit and
  number of stories read.
- [AliExpress gained](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/aliexpress) a 104% increase in conversion rate, 2x more page views and a 74% increase in time spent per session.
- [United eXtra Electronics gained](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/extra) 100% more sales and a 4x increase in re-engagement.
- [Flipkart gained](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/flipkart) a 3x increase in time spent and a 40% higher re-engagement rate.
- [5miles gained](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/5miles) 60% more conversions and decreased bounce rate by 50%.
