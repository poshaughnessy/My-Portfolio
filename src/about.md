## About me

![Peter speaking at RenderConf 2018](/images/pages/about/peter-renderconf-2018.jpg)

Hi! I'm a developer, writer and speaker on web APIs and the future of the web. I work in developer relations for 
[Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than 
you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)).

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in
a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development
agencies. I'm an occasional coach at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) and I've provided some remote mentoring for 
developers early on in their careers.

My key technology interests are around how web and native app capabilities are converging (e.g. Progressive Web App technologies) 
and how the physical and digital worlds are converging (Physical Web, Web Bluetooth, VR, Mixed Reality...). Recently I've 
been spending more time reading about and contemplating the ethics of technology: how to avoid some of the problems we 
have seen technology contribute to recently and how to apply web technologies to help make the world a better place.

If you would like to ask me something about web development or Samsung Internet, please send me a message on 
[Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/@peter), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy), or [send me an email](mailto:peter.oshaughnessy@gmail.com).
