Earlier this month I gave a [talk at the London Web
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/londonweb/events/51508282/) to introduce
developers to the world of WebGL and the _3D Web._

WebGL can be pretty daunting at first, for those of us without a
background in OpenGL or 3D programming. So I want to help other
developers know how to get started.

In a WebGL-capable browser (I recommend Chrome on the desktop), you can
check out my slides here:

I start by sharing some examples, then show what raw WebGL code is like,
without a library. It’s really low level and far more code than most of
us will want to write! So then I introduce Three.js, a high-level 3D
graphics library that makes it a lot easier. Then I share some simple
code you can use to create things like spinning 3D dinosaurs and
animated robots!

If you’d like to see the recording of the talk, here is the link,
although please note only one corner of the slides are visible in the
video, so you may wish to click through the slides yourself at the same
time to follow along:
