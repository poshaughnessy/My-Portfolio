## About me

Hi! I'm a developer, writer and speaker on web APIs and the future of the web. I work in developer relations for 
[Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than 
you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)).

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. My key technology interests 
are around how web and native app capabilities are converging (e.g. Progressive Web App technologies) and how the 
physical and digital worlds are converging (Physical Web, Web Bluetooth, VR, Mixed Reality...)
